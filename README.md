# Sample Integration

This is an example Knowledge integration. Learn how to take a third-party knowledge base, _Cool Shop Knowledge Hub_, and create an Ada Platform integration to sync articles from the Cool Shop Knowledge Hub to Ada's AI Agent.

This code covers the following aspects of building an integration:

- Setting up an integration server to handle OAuth callbacks from Ada, refresh tokens for Ada API access, and complete an installation flow to an Ada instance
- Register the integration with Ada, including required Ada API scopes and any configuration details needed to connect the third party system (e.g. Cool Shop Knowledge Hub) with Ada
- Handle installations from an Ada instance
